## Getting Started

### Development local API Server
_Location of server = /server_
Server depends on [node.js LTS Version: v6.11.2 ](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), and [sails.js](http://sailsjs.com/)
Please make sure you have these installed before proceeding forward.

Great, you are ready to proceed forward; awesome!

Let's start with running commands in your terminal, known as command line interface (CLI)

###### Install project dependancies
```Install project dependancies
# npm i
```
###### Install Sails.js globally
```Install sails global
# npm i sails -g
```
###### Start the server
```Start server
# node server
```
### You should now have access to your API server environment
debug: Environment : development
debug: Port        : 1337


If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
submitting an issue to our [Waffle Dashboard](https://waffle.io/udacity/mwnd-issues). Even better you can submit a Pull Request with a fix :)


### Development local Docker image

Given that you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed on your local system.
You can build a image of this source with the expected server versions for node.js and sails.js version.


Open your terminal and navigate into the folder that contains this source code. 
###### Build local Docker image
This command builds a new image named mws-server from the current directory.
```
docker build -t mws-server .
```


###### Start the server
Starts image named mws-server and exposes port 1337 outside the container.
```
docker run -p 1337:1337 mws-server
```

You should now have access to the server and be able to issue HTTP requests against the API.
